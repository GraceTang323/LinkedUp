# LinkedUp: A Better Way to Study
### An app designed by students for students
Studying is not only a way to elevate a student's academic performance. It's one of the best and most meaningful ways to form connections with others.
However, there is much more to university than sitting in the library all day.
College, by itself, is fundamentally a social space. Yet many people can find it difficult to enjoy mingling with others under the academic stress. 

With LinkedUp, you no longer have to choose between your social or academic life-- you can have both.

### Our Goal
We hope our app, will help students find and connect with more of their peers they otherwise would never have even talked to on campus. 

Students will be able to create a profile and select a series of subjects, classes, and attributes they are currently studying or interested in. 
Then, our matchmaker algorithm will find others with similar attributes, which are then displayed on the screen based on location.
Students can "link up" using our built-in text-messaging service, and schedule a session that works best.
